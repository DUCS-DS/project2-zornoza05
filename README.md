Question 1: If you were not already running at 60 fps, how much improvement did you
get?

Frame rate increased from 26 fps to 60 fps by optimizing distance calculations, nearly tripling performance.

Question 2: What is the time-complexity of your algorithm as it depends
on the number of nodes?

The sorting step runs in O(n log n), and the optimized forloop is O(n), resulting in an overall complexity of O(n log n).
